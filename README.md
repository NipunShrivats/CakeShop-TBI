Hey,

This repository contains a demo website that I have created to showcase my basic web dev skills for TBI submission.

// 1. Outline
I have created a website for a baker. I have used the demo logo and images i.e. no copyright images.

// 2. Content
This project uses HTML, CSS, SASS-SCSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, NodeJS and ExpressJS.

//3. Use
I have not used the traditional HTML files for managing my code by using handlebars instead.
"handlebars" aka "hbs" making it easier to manage the code without using react.
